Dr. Deima Katinait\u0117.</p> <p>In 2023, I completed Fabricademy course, which greatly inspired me to continue on this path. I sincerely recommend this course to anyone who is curious and wants to expand their knowledge in the field of textile technology.</p> <p>During the course, I met some very inspiring people who showed me so much that it was simply impossible to stop :) I am very grateful to my mentor Nuria Robles Miguelez, who taught me how to document creative processes. Inspired by her and Fabricademy course, I created this site so that failures and successes would be visible and unforgettable.</p>"},{"location":"experiments/documentation/","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>I'm not a coder, so I'll post some ready-made codes and links here, which took me a while to collect into one pile.</p> <p>James Willett provides very clear steps to follow.
