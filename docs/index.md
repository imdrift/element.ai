# Welcome to the heaven of failures!
This is my lab notebook for e-textiles: a place to document *experi*ments and *experi*ences.

This site is part of my Masters studies in [Vilnius Academy of Arts (VDA)](https://www.vda.lt/en/) Fashion Design programme. Master studies supervisors: for creative work Doc. Dainius Bendikas and for research Doc. Dr. Deima KatinaitÄ—.

In 2023, I completed [Fabricademy](https://textile-academy.org/) course, which greatly inspired me to continue on this path. I sincerely recommend this course to anyone who is curious and wants to expand their knowledge in the field of textile technology. 


# Documentation
During the course, I met some very inspiring people who showed me so much that it was simply impossible to stop :) I am very grateful to my mentor Nuria Robles Miguelez, who taught me [how to document creative processes](https://class.textile-academy.org/2023/ieva-dautartaite/). Inspired by her and Fabricademy course, I created this site so that failures and successes would be visible and unforgettable.

# Site
I'm not a coder, so I'll post some ready-made codes and links here, which took me a while to collect into one pile.

James Willett provides very clear steps to follow.
Tuttorials on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPEUhfTZswc) and his [website](https://jameswillett.dev/)
You can [download starter package](https://tinyurl.com/3n4tjmnn) to build.

Thomas Wilde created very cozy and [clear video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeZjkCtttss) with nice musical background.

## Tools
This site is build on [GitHub](https://github.com/) platform using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. It took me one week to remember and understand how to build the site, but the effort was worth it and now I can share some tips.
