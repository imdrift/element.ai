# Welcome to the heaven of failures!
This is my lab notebook for e-textiles: a place to document *experi*ments and *experi*ences.

This site is part of my Masters studies in [Vilnius Academy of Arts (VDA)](https://www.vda.lt/en/) Fashion Design programme. Master studies supervisors: for creative work Doc. Dainius Bendikas and for research Doc. Dr. Deima KatinaitÄ—.

In 2023, I completed [Fabricademy](https://textile-academy.org/) course, which greatly inspired me to continue on this path. I sincerely recommend this course to anyone who is curious and wants to expand their knowledge in the field of textile technology. 

# Documentation
During the course, I met some very inspiring people who showed me so much that it was simply impossible to stop :) I am very grateful to my mentor Nuria Robles Miguelez, who taught me [how to document creative processes](https://class.textile-academy.org/2023/ieva-dautartaite/). Inspired by her and Fabricademy course, I created this site so that failures and successes would be visible and unforgettable.
